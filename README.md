## Description

## Usage

When the user first lands on the note-taker app, they will see a homepage. When they click on the "Get Started" CTA, the user will land on the notes page. They can view all their previous saved notes on the left rail navigation. Furthermore, users can open a previously saved note to read the details of the note or even delete it if they wish to.
